                    <h3>Schematic</h3>
                    <div class="imageA1Schem"></div>
                    <p>I used a 100 and two 220 resistors for the blue and yellow/red leds<br>
                        respectively as they were the smallest resistors possible while <br>
                        not overloading the LEDs max current. The blue LED has a higher voltage <br>
                        drop so has a smaller resistor.</p>
                    <p>Resistor math: <br> 
                        RYG LEDs have a 1.8 V drop => 5 V (from power) - 1.8 V = 3.2 V<br>
                        3.2 V / 0.02 I (ideal current) = 160 立 (Closest higher 立 resistor is 220)<br>
                        This math is repeated for Blue & White LEDs 3.3 V drop giving us 85 立 rounded <br>
                        to the closest resistor of 100 立</p>
