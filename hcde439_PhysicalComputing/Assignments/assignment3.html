                path to ground while also limiting max current. It is also in the same 
                resistance range as the photoresistor allowing me to get accurate readings</p></div>
            <div style="max-width: 30rem;"><p>The lumen reader I made has tick marks where I could capture a
                constant reading. While I could get the photoresistor to output ~1010 
                with the serial read it involved having my phone LED directly on the 
                sensor, this made it impossible for me to capture a lumen reading with my 
                phones LDR and so the lumen count for MAX is unknown but could be extrapolated. </p></div>

// These constants won't change. They're used to initialize the ports the pins used:
const int lightIn = A0; //Analog input pin that will be converted to the angle for the servo
const int servoPin = 3; //analog output pin that will control angle to the servo

//these variables will change and used to pass data in the code
int lightRead = 0; //raw value from photoresistor. Not to long of a value... you could say its a lightweight read
int sevOut = 0; //mapped value outputted to servo

# include &lt;Servo.h&gt; //adds library for servo
Servo myS; //initalizes servo as myS

void setup() {
    // put your setup code here, to run once:
    Serial.begin(9600); // Initializes serial output @ 9600 cereals err bits a second. Useful for learning, mapping and debugging.
    myS.attach(servoPin); // Initializes servopin as a servopin output with the servo library
}

void loop() {
    // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:
    
    lightRead = analogRead(lightIn); //reads the raw value from the photoresistor

    //following chunk sends photo resistor readings to serial
    Serial.print("raw light: ");
    Serial.println(lightRead);

    sevOut = map(lightRead, 0, 1023, 0, 180);//maps input and output 20 was the lowest reading so defaulted to 0 to avoid the use of constrain the highest was 1010 so again I defaulted to 1023
    myS.write(sevOut); //outputs to servo
    delay(500); //lets the servo move with out being interupted 

//    myS.write(180); //outputs to servo. Used for attaching the needle to the servo
